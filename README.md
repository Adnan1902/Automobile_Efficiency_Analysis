# Automobile Fuel Efficiency Analysis Project

A comprehensive data analysis project that explores historical trends and relationships in automobile fuel efficiency using the Auto MPG dataset. This analysis investigates how various vehicle characteristics influence fuel economy and examines patterns across different manufacturing regions and time periods.

## Project Overview

This analysis examines the complex relationships between automobile characteristics and their fuel efficiency, providing insights into:
- Historical trends in fuel efficiency from the 1970s and 1980s
- The impact of vehicle design choices on miles per gallon (MPG)
- Regional differences in automobile characteristics
- Relationships between performance metrics like horsepower and acceleration
- The trade-offs between fuel efficiency and other vehicle attributes

## Features

### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
The project implements robust data cleaning procedures including:
- Conversion of horsepower values to numeric format with appropriate handling of missing values
- Transformation of origin codes into meaningful categorical labels (USA, Europe, Asia)
- Verification of data integrity through duplicate and null value checks
- Standardization of data types across all variables

### Visualization Suite
The analysis includes six carefully crafted visualizations that reveal different aspects of the dataset:

1. Temporal Analysis
   - Historical MPG trends across model years
   - Visualization of efficiency improvements over time
   - Identification of key turning points in fuel economy

2. Mechanical Relationships
   - Impact of cylinder count on fuel efficiency
   - Weight-to-MPG relationship analysis
   - Horsepower and acceleration correlations

3. Regional Comparisons
   - Distribution of fuel efficiency by manufacturing region
   - Regional differences in design approaches
   - Market-specific characteristics analysis

4. Statistical Analysis
   - Correlation matrix of all numerical variables
   - Distribution patterns of key metrics
   - Relationship strength quantification

## Requirements

```python
pandas>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.18.0
matplotlib>=3.2.0
seaborn>=0.10.0
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adnan1902/Automobile_Efficiency_Analysis.git
cd auto-mpg-analysis
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure your dataset ('auto-mpg.csv') is located in the specified path:
```python
file_path = '/mnt/data/auto-mpg.csv'
```

2. Run the analysis script:
```bash
python auto_mpg_analysis.py
```

3. The script will generate six visualizations and provide detailed statistical insights:
   - MPG temporal trends
   - Cylinder count analysis
   - Weight-MPG relationships
   - Horsepower-Acceleration patterns
   - Regional MPG distributions
   - Correlation heatmap

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals several significant insights about automobile development:

1. Temporal Patterns
   - A marked increase in fuel efficiency after 1973, coinciding with the oil crisis
   - Steady improvement in MPG across all regions over time
   - Technological advances leading to better efficiency without sacrificing performance

2. Design Relationships
   - Strong negative correlation between vehicle weight and fuel efficiency
   - Clear trade-off between horsepower and MPG
   - Optimal cylinder configurations for different efficiency targets

3. Regional Characteristics
   - Asian manufacturers consistently prioritizing fuel efficiency
   - European designs balancing performance with efficiency
   - American vehicles traditionally focusing on power and size
